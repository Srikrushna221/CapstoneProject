        "The aim of this project is to help people who want to relocate to the safest borough in London, expats can chose the neighborhoods to which they want to relocate based on the most common venues in it. For example if a person is looking for a neighborhood with good connectivity and public transportation we can see that Clusters 3 and 4 have Train stations and Bus stops as the most common venues. If a person is looking for a neighborhood with stores and restaurants in a close proximity then the neighborhoods in the first cluster is suitable. For a family I feel that the neighborhoods in Cluster 4 are more suitable dues to the common venues in that cluster, these neighborhoods have common venues such as Parks, Gym/Fitness centers, Bus Stops, Restaurants, Electronics Stores and Soccer fields which is ideal for a family.
